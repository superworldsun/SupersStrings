                    <string id="270885452">In the BATTLE ARENA, we undertake the Set KO Tourney. All\nparticipants enter with a team of three POKéMON. The three\nPOKéMON must be lined up in the order in which they are to\nappear. During battle, the POKéMON will appear one at a\ntime in the preset order. Once a POKéMON enters battle, it must\nremain out until the match is decided. If a match remains\nundecided in three turns, it goes to judging. If you wish to\ninterrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don't\nsave, you will not be able to continue with your challenge.\nIf you pull off the feat of beating seven TRAINERS in succession,\nwe will present you with Battle Points.</string>

                    <string id="270888450">The Set KO Tourney has special rules, unlike standard battles.\nFirst, one battle lasts only three turns. If the outcome is not\ndecided after three turns, it goes to judging. The REFEREE will\nchoose the winner based on how the POKéMON battled.\nAlso, a POKéMON cannot be switched out until its battle's\noutcome is decided.</string>
                    <string id="270888771">The first judging factor is «Mind.»\nThis factor evaluates how aggressive the battlers were.\nThe judging is based on how often the TRAINERS ordered\nthe use of offensive moves.</string>
                    <string id="270888946">The second judging factor is «Skill.»\nThis factor evaluates how effectively POKéMON moves were\nused. If a move worked successfully, the Skill rating goes up.\nIf a move failed, the Skill rating is lowered. If it was an offensive\nmove, the Skill rating goes up if the move was «super effective»\nand goes down if it was «not very effective.» The Skill rating will\nnot go up for moves such as PROTECT and DETECT. If the\nopponent used PROTECT or DETECT, and your POKéMON\nfailed to hit with a move, its Skill rating will not go down.</string>
                    <string id="270889474">The third judging factor is «Body.»\nThis factor is based on how much HP remained at the end of a\nbattle. The rating takes into account how much HP a POKéMON\nhad at the start of battle, and what remained at the end.</string>
