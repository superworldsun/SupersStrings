    <string id="1626671">Today, in addition to our lesson,\nwe came to see the chamber.</string>
    <string id="1626733">My, how extraordinary.</string>
    <string id="1626756">Ah, so you are studying POKéMON\non your own...\n\nYes, you certainly are quite the\nextraordinary person, indeed.</string>

    <string id="1627588">DAISY: {01}, I heard you had\na battle against {06}.\n\nI wish I'd seen that!</string>
    <string id="1627658">Grandpa asked you to run an\nerrand?\n\nGee, that's lazy of him.\nHere, this will help you.</string>
    <string id="1627745">{01} received a TOWN MAP\nfrom DAISY.</string>
    <string id="1627780">You don't have space for this in\nyour BAG.</string>
    <string id="1627823">You can use the TOWN MAP to find\nout where you are, or check the\n\nnames of places.</string>
    <string id="1627905">DAISY: Just like people, POKéMON\nare living things.\n\nWhen they get tired, please give\nthem a rest.</string>
    <string id="1628003">It's a big map of the KANTO region.\nNow this would be useful!</string>
    <string id="1628065">The shelves are crammed full of\nbooks on POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1628115">DAISY: Hi, {01}!\nGood timing.\n\nI'm about to have some tea.\nWould you like to join me?\n\nOh, but look.\nYour POKéMON are a little dirty.\n\nWould you like me to groom one?</string>
    <string id="1628277">You don't need any grooming done?\nOkay, we'll just have tea.</string>
    <string id="1628338">Which one should I groom?</string>
    <string id="1628364">DAISY: Okay, I'll get it looking\nnice in no time.</string>
    <string id="1628414">{02} looks dreamily content...\n\nDAISY: There you go! All done.\nSee? Doesn't it look nice?\n\nGiggle...\nIt's such a cute POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1628539">Oh, sorry. I honestly can't\ngroom an EGG.</string>
    <string id="1628581">DAISY: Your POKéMON grow to love\nyou if you raise them with love.\n\nFor example, {01}, may I see\nyour first POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="1628694">It couldn't possibly love you\nany more than it does now.\n\nYour POKéMON is happy beyond\nwords.</string>
    <string id="1628787">It looks very happy.\n\nI wish {06} could see this and\nlearn something from it.</string>
    <string id="1628862">It's quite friendly with you.\nKeep being good to it!</string>
    <string id="1628915">It's warming up to you.\nTrust must be growing between you.</string>
    <string id="1628974">It's not quite familiar with you\nyet.\n\nPOKéMON are all quite wary when\nyou first get them.</string>
    <string id="1629064">{01}, I don't like the way it\nglares at you.\n\nCould you try being a little nicer\nto it?</string>
    <string id="1629149">...Um, it's not easy for me to say\nthis, but...\n\nIs there some reason why your\nPOKéMON would hate you so much?</string>
    <string id="1629255">«The lovely and sweet\nCLEFAIRY»</string>
    <string id="1629287">{06}: What, it's only {01}?\nGramps isn't around.</string>

    <string id="1629674">WHAT?\nUnbelievable!\n\nI picked the wrong POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="1629722">{06}: Yeah!\nAm I great or what?</string>

    <string id="1629837">{06}: Gramps!</string>
    <string id="1629849">{06}: I almost forgot!\nWhat did you call me for?</string>
    <string id="1629896">{06}: All right, Gramps!\nLeave it all to me!</string>
    <string id="1629939">{01}, I hate to say it, but you\nwon't be necessary for this.\n\nI know! I'll borrow a TOWN MAP\nfrom my sis!\n\nI'll tell her not to lend you one,\n{01}! Hahaha!\n\nDon't bother coming around to\nmy place after this!</string>
    <string id="1630140">OAK: {06}?\nLet me think...\n\nOh, that's right, I told you to\ncome! Just wait!\n\nHere, {01}.\n\nThere are three POKéMON here.\n\nHaha!\n\nThe POKéMON are held inside\nthese POKé BALLS.\n\nWhen I was young, I was a serious\nPOKéMON TRAINER.\n\nBut now, in my old age, I have\nonly these three left.\n\nYou can have one.\nGo on, choose!</string>
    <string id="1630442">OAK: Be patient, {06}.\nYou can have one, too!</string>
    <string id="1630486">OAK: Now, {01}.\n\nInside those three POKé BALLS are\nPOKéMON.\n\nWhich one will you choose for\nyourself?</string>
    <string id="1630583">OAK: Hey!\nDon't go away yet!</string>
    <string id="1630612">Ah! CHARMANDER is your choice.\nYou should raise it patiently.\n\nSo, {01}, you're claiming the\nFIRE POKéMON CHARMANDER?</string>
    <string id="1630727">Hm! SQUIRTLE is your choice.\nIt's one worth raising.\n\nSo, {01}, you've decided on the\nWATER POKéMON SQUIRTLE?</string>
    <string id="1630834">I see! BULBASAUR is your choice.\nIt's very easy to raise.\n\nSo, {01}, you want to go with\nthe GRASS POKéMON BULBASAUR?</string>
    <string id="1630949">This POKéMON is really quite\nenergetic!</string>
    <string id="1630989">{01} received the {02}\nfrom PROF. OAK!</string>
    <string id="1631024">OAK: If a wild POKéMON appears,\nyour POKéMON can battle it.\n\nWith it at your side, you should be\nable to reach the next town.</string>
    <string id="1631149">OAK: {01}, raise your young\nPOKéMON by making it battle.\n\nIt has to battle for it to grow.</string>
    <string id="1631237">OAK: Oh, {01}!\nHow is my old POKéMON?\n\nWell, it seems to be growing more\nattached to you.\n\nYou must be talented as a POKéMON\nTRAINER.\n\nWhat's that?\nYou have something for me?</string>
    <string id="1631407">{01} delivered OAK'S PARCEL.</string>
    <string id="1631434">Ah! \nIt's the custom POKé BALL!\n\nI had it on order.\nThank you!</string>
    <string id="1631496">OAK: Oh, right!\nI have a request for you two.</string>
    <string id="1631542">On the desk there is my invention,\nthe POKéDEX!\n\nIt automatically records data on\nPOKéMON you've seen or caught.\n\nIt's a high-tech encyclopedia!</string>
    <string id="1631685">OAK: {01} and {06}.\nTake these with you.</string>
    <string id="1631722">{01} received the POKéDEX\nfrom PROF. OAK.</string>
    <string id="1631762">OAK: You can't get detailed data\non POKéMON by just seeing them.\n\nYou must catch them to obtain\ncomplete data.\n\nSo, here are some tools for\ncatching wild POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1631923">{01} received five POKé BALLS.</string>
    <string id="1631952">When a wild POKéMON appears,\nit's fair game.\n\nJust throw a POKé BALL at it and\ntry to catch it!\n\nThis won't always work, however.\n\nA healthy POKéMON can escape.\nYou have to be lucky!</string>
    <string id="1632132">To make a complete guide on all\nthe POKéMON in the world...\n\nThat was my dream!\n\nBut, I'm too old.\nI can't get the job done.\n\nSo, I want you two to fulfill my\ndream for me.\n\nGet moving, you two.\n\nThis is a great undertaking in\nPOKéMON history!</string>
    <string id="1632369">POKéMON around the world wait for\nyou, {01}!</string>
    <string id="1632412">Ah, {01}!\nHow is your POKéDEX shaping up?\n\n{06} has already caught some\nPOKéMON and added to the data.\n\nSo, {01}, let's have a look at\nyour POKéDEX.\n\n...What's the matter?\nYou've added no new data at all.\n\nI'll give you these, so do try a\nlittle harder.</string>
    <string id="1632654">OAK: Come see me sometime.\n\nAfter all, I want to know how your\nPOKéDEX is coming along.</string>
    <string id="1632741">It's like an encyclopedia, but the\npages are blank.</string>
    <string id="1632793">Those are POKé BALLS.\nThey contain POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="1632837">That's PROF. OAK's last POKéMON.</string>

    <string id="1633254">I study POKéMON as PROF. OAK's\nAIDE.</string>
    <string id="1633291">Hi, {01}. I bet you've become\ngood friends with your POKéMON.\n\nBy the way, did you know about\nDAISY?\n\nIf you show DAISY your POKéMON,\nshe can tell how much it likes you.\n\nOccasionally, she will even groom\na POKéMON for you.\n\nThis is a secret, so please don't\ntell anyone.</string>
    <string id="1633557">PROF. OAK is going to have his own\nradio show soon.\n\nThe program will be called PROF.\nOAK's POKéMON SEMINAR.</string>
    <string id="1633665">PROF. OAK may not look like much,\nbut he's the authority on POKéMON.\n\nMany POKéMON TRAINERS hold him in\nhigh regard.</string>
    <string id="1633781">Ah, now this is excellent!\n\n{01}, I have another important\nfavor to ask of you.\n\nI need you to listen closely.</string>
    <string id="1633888">Recently, there have been sightings\nof many rare POKéMON species.\n\nI'm talking about POKéMON that\nhave never been seen in KANTO.\n\nI would love to go see things for\nmyself, but I'm much too old.\n\nSince I can't do it, {01}, I'd\nlike you to go in my place.</string>
    <string id="1634137">{06}: Hey, I heard that!\n\nGramps, what's with favoring\n{01} over me all the time?\n\nI went and collected more POKéMON,\nand faster, too.\n\nYou should just let me handle\neverything.</string>
    <string id="1634308">OAK: I know, I know.\nOf course I need your help, too.\n\nNow, I need to see both your\nPOKéDEXES.</string>
    <string id="1634402">PROF. OAK took both POKéDEX\nunits.</string>
    <string id="1634437">... ... ...  ... ... ...\n\n... ... ...  ... ... ...\n\n...And that's done!\n\nNow these units can record data on\na lot more POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1634536">{01}'s POKéDEX was upgraded!</string>
    <string id="1634563">Now, {01} and {06}!\n\nThis time, you really must work\ntowards filling your POKéDEXES.\n\nI urge you to make them the best\nand the most complete of all time!\n\nTruly, this is a monumentally great\nundertaking in POKéMON history!</string>
    <string id="1634779">{06}: Gramps, calm down.\nDon't get so excited.\n\nI'll get the POKéDEX completed,\ndon't you worry about a thing.\n\nI think I'll try looking around\nONE ISLAND first...\n\nAnyways, I'm outta here!</string>
    <string id="1634962">Coming up with nicknames is fun,\nbut it's not so easy to do.\n\nClever names are nice, but simple\nnames are easier to remember.</string>

    <string id="1636812">Wait!\nI was just careless!</string>
    <string id="1636839">VIRIDIAN GYM was closed for a\nlong time.\n\nBut now, our LEADER is back!</string>
    <string id="1636909">I was beaten?</string>

    <string id="1636993">Yo!\nChamp in the making!\n\nEven I don't know the VIRIDIAN\nLEADER's identity.\n\nBut one thing's certain.\nThis will be the toughest of all\n\nthe GYM LEADERS.\n\nAlso, I heard that the TRAINERS\nhere like GROUND-type POKéMON.</string>

    <string id="1637419">Okay!\n\nBe sure to read what's on the\nblackboard carefully!</string>
    <string id="1637477">Let's check out the notebook.\n\nFirst page...\n\nPOKé BALLS are used to catch\nPOKéMON.\n\nUp to six POKéMON can be carried\nin your party.\n\nPeople who raise and battle\nwith POKéMON are called TRAINERS.</string>
    <string id="1637667">Second page...\n\nA healthy POKéMON may be hard to\ncatch, so weaken it first.\n\nPoison, burn, or cause another\nstatus problem to weaken it.</string>
    <string id="1637800">Third page...\n\nPOKéMON TRAINERS seek others to\nengage in POKéMON battles.\n\nTo TRAINERS, the taste of victory\nis sweet, indeed.\n\nBattles are constantly waged at\nPOKéMON GYMS everywhere.</string>
    <string id="1637980">Fourth page...\n\nThe ultimate goal for all POKéMON\nTRAINERS is simple.\n\nIt is to defeat the top eight\nPOKéMON GYM LEADERS.\n\nDo so to earn the right to face...\n\nThe ELITE FOUR of the POKéMON\nLEAGUE!</string>

    <string id="1638184">GIRL: Hey!\nDon't look at my notes!</string>
    <string id="1638219">The blackboard lists POKéMON\nSTATUS problems during battles.</string>
    <string id="1638280">Which topic do you want to read?</string>
    <string id="1638313">A POKéMON can't attack if it's\nasleep.\n\nPOKéMON will stay asleep even\nafter battles.\n\nUse AWAKENING to awaken one\nfrom sleep.</string>
    <string id="1638437">A burn reduces ATTACK power.\nIt also causes ongoing HP loss.\n\nA burn remains after a battle.\nUse BURN HEAL to cure a burn.</string>
    <string id="1638559">When poisoned, a POKéMON's health\nsteadily drops.\n\nPoison lingers after battles.\nUse an ANTIDOTE to cure poison!</string>
    <string id="1638671">A frozen POKéMON becomes\nhelplessly immobile.\n\nIt stays frozen even after the\nbattle ends.\n\nUse ICE HEAL to thaw out the\nsuffering POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1638809">Paralysis reduces SPEED and may\nprevent the POKéMON from moving.\n\nParalysis remains after battles.\nUse PARLYZ HEAL for treatment.</string>
    <string id="1638938">Hey!\nYou came from PALLET TOWN?</string>
    <string id="1638970">You know PROF. OAK, right?\n\nHis order came in.\nCan I get you to take it to him?</string>
    <string id="1639049">{01} received OAK'S PARCEL\nfrom the POKéMON MART clerk.</string>
    <string id="1639103">Okay, thanks! Please say hi to\nPROF. OAK for me, too.</string>
    <string id="1639157">This shop does good business in\nANTIDOTES, I've heard.</string>
    <string id="1639212">I've got to buy some POTIONS.\n\nYou never know when your POKéMON\nwill need quick healing.</string>
    <string id="1639300">Please feel free to use that PC in\nthe corner.\n\nThe receptionist told me so.\nIt's so kind of her!</string>
    <string id="1639397">There's a POKéMON CENTER in every\ntown ahead.\n\nThey charge no money, so don't\nbe shy about healing POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1639504">POKéMON CENTERS heal your tired,\nhurt, or fainted POKéMON.\n\nThey make all POKéMON completely\nhealthy.</string>
    <string id="1639605">Yes, yes.\nIt's $50 for a child's ticket.\n\nWould you like to come in?</string>
    <string id="1639673">Come again!</string>

    <string id="1654959">Even if they are the same level,\nPOKéMON can have very different\n\nstats and abilities.\n\nA POKéMON raised by a TRAINER is\nstronger than one in the wild.</string>
    <string id="1655109">My POKéMON was poisoned!\nIt fainted while we were walking!</string>
    <string id="1655168">It is true that a higher-level\nPOKéMON will be more powerful...\n\nBut, all POKéMON will have weak\npoints against specific types.\n\nSo, there appears to be no\nuniversally strong POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1655348">The urge to battle with someone\nyou've tangled with before...\n\nHave you ever had that urge?\nI'm sure you have.\n\nI wanted to battle certain people\nagain over and over, too.\n\nSo, I've been giving these away.\nPlease, take one!</string>
    <string id="1655567">Use that device and you'll find\nTRAINERS looking for a rematch.\n\nYou have to charge its battery to\nuse it, though.</string>
    <string id="1655681">How do you use the VS SEEKER?\nThere's nothing to it.\n\nUse it like beep-beep-beep, and\nTRAINERS around you will notice.\n\nIf any TRAINER wants a rematch,\nit will let you know immediately.\n\nCharge its battery and use it\nwhile you're on a road.</string>
    <string id="1655919">Won't you admire my PIKACHU's\nadorable tail?</string>
    <string id="1655964">Humph!\n\nMy PIKACHU is twice as cute as\nthat one!</string>
    <string id="1656012">I just adore my SEEL!\nIt's so lovable!\n\nIt squeals, «Kyuuuh,» when I\nhug it!</string>
    <string id="1656088">Oh, dear!\n\nMy SEEL is far more attractive.\nBy double, I would say.</string>
    <string id="1656154">PIKACHU: Chu! Pikachu!</string>
    <string id="1656177">SEEL: Kyuoo!</string>
    <string id="1656190">I chair the POKéMON Fan Club!\n\nI raise more than a hundred\nPOKéMON!\n\nI'm very fussy when it comes to\nPOKéMON! I surely am!\n\nSo...\n\nDid you come visit to hear about\nmy POKéMON?</string>

    <string id="1656654">{01} received a BIKE VOUCHER\nfrom the CHAIRMAN.</string>
    <string id="1656700">Take that BIKE VOUCHER to the\nBIKE SHOP in CERULEAN CITY.\n\nExchange that for a BICYCLE\nfree of charge!\n\nDon't worry, my favorite FEAROW\nwill FLY me anywhere I need to go.\n\nSo, I have no need for a BICYCLE.\n\nI hope you like cycling!</string>
    <string id="1656928">Oh. Come back when you want to\nhear my story!</string>
    <string id="1656974">Hello, {01}!\n\nDid you come see me about my\nPOKéMON again?\n\nNo?\nToo bad!</string>
    <string id="1657042">Make room for this!</string>
    <string id="1657062">Our CHAIRMAN is very vocal about\nPOKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1657104">Let's all listen politely to other\nTRAINERS!</string>
    <string id="1657149">If someone brags, brag right back!</string>
    <string id="1657184">Our CHAIRMAN really does adore his\nPOKéMON.\n\nBut the person who is most liked by\nPOKéMON is DAISY, I think.</string>
    <string id="1657291">Hi!\nDo you have a {02}?\n\nWant to trade it for my\n{03}?</string>
    <string id="1657341">That's too bad.</string>
    <string id="1657357">...This is no {02}.\n\nIf you get one, please trade it\nto me!</string>
    <string id="1657412">Thank you!</string>
    <string id="1657423">How is my old {03}?\n\nMy {02} is doing great!</string>
    <string id="1657463">There are wicked people who will\nuse POKéMON for criminal acts.\n\nTEAM ROCKET traffics in rare\nPOKéMON, for example.\n\nThey also abandon POKéMON that\nthey consider unpopular or useless.\n\nThat's the sort of horrid people\nthey are, TEAM ROCKET.</string>
    <string id="1657701">I think POKéMON can be good or\nbad. It depends on the TRAINER.</string>
    <string id="1657764">Hey, kid! What do you think you're\ndoing here?\n\nYou won't live long in combat!\nNot with your puny power!\n\nI tell you, kid, electric POKéMON\nsaved me during the war!\n\nThey zapped my enemies into\nparalysis!\n\nThe same as I'll do to you!</string>
    <string id="1657998">A little word of advice, kid!\n\nElectricity is sure powerful!\n\nBut, it's useless against GROUND-\ntype POKéMON!</string>

    <string id="1670883">The SAFARI ZONE actually has\nfour zones in it.\n\nEach zone has different kinds of\nPOKéMON, even some rare ones.\n\nUse the supplied SAFARI BALLS to\ncatch them.\n\nYou can also throw BAIT or ROCKS\nbesides the SAFARI BALLS.\n\nIf you throw BAIT, the POKéMON\nbecomes less likely to flee, but\n\nharder to catch.\n\nIf you throw ROCKS, the POKéMON\nbecomes more likely to flee, but\n\neasier to catch.\n\nWhen you run out of time or SAFARI\nBALLS, it's game over for you!</string>

    <string id="1672745">Strength isn't the key for POKéMON.\nDo you understand this?\n\nPOKéMON is about strategy!\n\nI'll show you how strategy can\nbeat brute strength.</string>
    <string id="1672884">What?\nExtraordinary!</string>
    <string id="1672905">So, you mix brawn with brains?\nGood strategy!\n\nThat's remarkable for a child\nTRAINER.</string>

    <string id="1845843">LEA: Sometimes, the intensity of\nour love scares me.</string>
    <string id="1845896">I told you, there's no getting rich\nquick in battling kids.</string>

    <string id="1846060">VOLTORB's going to seriously\nelectrify you today!</string>
    <string id="1846110">I leveled up my POKéMON, but it\nabsolutely won't evolve. Why?</string>
    <string id="1846172">Gaah! I really need to exercise\nand seriously trim some flab!</string>
    <string id="1846234">Be a rebel!</string>

    <string id="1846695">I tried diving for POKéMON again,\nbut it was a no-go like before.</string>
    <string id="1846761">I look at the sea to forget all\nthe bad things that happened.\n\n...Like losing to you the last time!</string>
    <string id="1846858">You always get to ride your\nPOKéMON...\n\nIt looks so relaxing.\nCan I have it if I win?</string>
    <string id="1846941">Swimming's great!\nSunburns aren't!</string>
    <string id="1846976">These waters are treacherous!\nYou shouldn't come back here!</string>
    <string id="1847036">I swam here with my friends...\nI'm tired...\n\nMust we really battle again?</string>
    <string id="1847105">LIA: You know my brother just\nbecame a TRAINER, right?\n\nI want to make him better, so I\nneed your help again.</string>

    <string id="1847283">The water is shallow here.\nThere are many people swimming.</string>
    <string id="1847342">Are you jealous that I'm\nvacationing on SEAFOAM?</string>
    <string id="1847391">I love floating with the fishes\nhere among the waves.</string>

    <string id="1847533">Why are you riding a POKéMON?\nHaven't you learned to swim yet?</string>
    <string id="1847596">I rode my bird POKéMON here.</string>

    <string id="1847857">I got a big haul again!\nWanna go for it once more?</string>
    <string id="1847908">The sea cleanses my body and soul!</string>
    <string id="1847960">I caught my POKéMON at sea.\nAnd that's where I train them.</string>
    <string id="1848019">Right now, I'm in another triathlon\nmeet!</string>

    <string id="1848965">The time we battled...\n\nEven though I was the second in\nline, I was the best, wasn't I?</string>
    <string id="1849050">People call this the NUGGET\nBRIDGE!\n\nYou've already beaten us, so you're\nnot allowed to take the challenge...\n\n...But, you're welcome to battle with\nus again.</string>
    <string id="1849203">Lying back, rocked by the waves...\nI don't notice time slipping by...</string>

    <string id="1849667">Dress appropriately for battle!\nLose that frivolous outfit, I said!</string>
    <string id="1849735">You know, everything tastes great\nwhen you're out in the wild.</string>

    <string id="1850480">I haven't made any progress...\nI still can't get the right angle...</string>
    <string id="1850544">Oh, you will give me another\nopportunity to match wits with you?</string>
    <string id="1850609">They're almost finished making the\npool for my POKéMON.\n\nYou must drop in for a visit.</string>
